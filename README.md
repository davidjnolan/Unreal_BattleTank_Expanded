# Unreal_BattleTank_Expanded
A personal learning journey, expanding on the Battle Tank Tutorial project

This project is an expansion of the Battle Tank Project. Battle Tank was a tutorial project, completed by following along with the [Complete Unreal Creator course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview). The course focuses on teaching C++ for Unreal Engine to C++ beginners.

Battle Tank Expanded is an opportunity for me to further my learning by adding to the Battle Tank project in a self-directed manner. There are no specific goals to the project, I just intend to keep adding functionality in an ad-hoc manner. The intent is just to challenge myself and further cemement my learning.
